          I felt like writing a small tool to tag files and make thoes tags
          easily available. The currently available tools (at least those I
          found) feel too much like sledgehammers.<br /><br />

          Motivations:
          <ul>
             <li>Make tagging dead-simple (windows shell integration, command-line)</li>
             <li>If a file is tagged in one OS, this tag should be usable in other OSes</li>
             <li>Don't rely on a central database, keep the tags as close as possible to the files</li>
          </ul>

          Design decisions:
          <ul>
             <li>Store the tags in a reusable and flexible file-format --> SQLite3</li>
             <li>Store this file in the same folder as the files themseves (similar to thumbs.db)
               <ul>
                  <li>Distributed storage decreases the loss of data</li>
                  <li>If a folder with files are deleted, all attached tags are gone as well.</li>
                  <li>retrieving the tags becomes more complicated</li>
               </ul>
               </li>
             <li>Store as little information about the files as possible. It's enough to be able to identify them (filename, tag)</li>
             <li>Don't give the tags any numeric IDs. Use their name as natural key (makes merging the distributed tag files trivial but increases storage volume)</li>
          </ul>

       <p>BE WARNED:<br /> This is in a very early stage of development. I develop it in
      first line for myself. I do not care about performance and such... for
      now. I dunno how well it will perform on millions of files. But that's
      out of the scope of my need anyhow. As it is right now, tagging and
      un-tagging seems to work well. If files are renamed, there tags are
      obviously lost. That's not easily detectable. Hashing the files also
      won't work as the contents of the files are usually subject to
      change.</p>

      <p> Searching in the created tag-indexes is non-trivial as one needs to
      collect all tags from all tag-container-files before searching. For large
      file-sets (think of subdirectories) this may kill resources (memory or
      disk-space depending on how it's implemented). Again, that's out of scope
      of my needs.  </p>

      <p>As of now, I've finished the most basic operations for tagging. I
      probable won't get a lot of time to get more work done over the
      forseeable future. But eventually I will fool around a bit more. Until
      then, have fun... or not.... with this toy</p>

      <p>As usually with OSS, if anyone happens to create a solution for
      browsing the tag-"swarms", feel free to let me know</p>
